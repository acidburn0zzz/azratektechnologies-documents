## Licenses
Licenses in this repository are the most up-to-date. If the license of a software licensed under an Azratek license is updated at some point,
then the previous license will be revoked. We keep a log of these changes in `doc/LICENSE-CHANGELOG.md`. If you've released a software licensed
under an outdated Azratek license, please update the license and submit a pull request, adding your software to the changelog.
